    <h2>Who invented evolution?</h2>
    <p>Born on February 12, 1809, Charles Robert Darwin changed the world. He originally wanted to study medicine and become a doctor
      like his ancestors. But when he was offered a place on the HMS Beagle in 1831 he took it and became a natural scientist. As
      planned, he spent most of his time on land and investigating geology. The fossils he found on the beaches were evidence of animals 
      who lived many thousands or even millions of years ago. But he discovered evolution when HMS Beagle stopped at the galapagos islands.
      He realised that each island had its own type of finch who were all related but different in important ways. This is when he came up
      with his theory of evolution.</p>
